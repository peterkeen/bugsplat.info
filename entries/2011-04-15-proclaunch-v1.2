Title: ProcLaunch v1.2

Just a few bug fixes this time:

 * When you send proclaunch `SIGHUP`, it will send all of the profiles their respective stop signals and then wait for them to shut down. You can tell proclaunch to stop without waiting by sending `SIGHUP` again.
 * You can pass the `--log-path` command line option to change where proclaunch writes it's log. By default this is `$profile_dir/error.log`
