Title: Managing Your Processes with ProcLaunch.

*Edit 2010-08-08 17:47: ProcLaunch now has a CPAN-compatible install process. See below for details.*

I finally got the chance to work some more on [proclaunch][], my implementation of a *user space process manager*, like runit or mongrel or god. I wrote up a big overview of the currently available options [previously][uspm], but in summary: all of the existing options suck. They're either hard to setup, have memory leaks, have a weird configuration language, or are just plain strange. The only viable option was [procer][], and even that was just sort of a tech demo put together for the [Mongrel2 manual][].

That's why I started putting together proclaunch. I need some of the features of runit, namely automatic restart, with none of the wackyness, and I wanted it to be easy to automatically configure. I also wanted it to be standalone so I wouldn't have to install a pre-alpha version of Mongrel2 just to manage my own processes.

### What of it?

Grab the latest version off of github, unpack it, and run this in the unpacked directory:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build
    $ ./Build install
    
If everything went smoothly you'll have `proclaunch` somewhere in your path. Now, fire it up:

    $ mkdir -p /path/to/some/state/directory
    $ sudo proclaunch \
        --debug \
        --foreground \
        /path/to/some/state/directory \
        example_profiles/
        
If everything goes according to plan, you'll see a bunch of debug info scroll past showing that it scanned the profiles directory, found one called `sleeper`, and kicked it off. Then, every five seconds you'll see it rescan. If you look in your process list for `sleep` you'll see bash happily kicking off a `sleep 10` in an infinite loop as the `nobody` user. Now, run this:

    $ sudo kill `cat /path/to/some/state/directory/proclaunch.pid`
    
You should still see the sleep going on, but `proclaunch` shouldn't show up anywhere. If you launch `proclaunch` again, you'll see it startup but never start `sleeper`, since it's already running. This may seem really mundane, but you can't make runit behave this way without some major hacks. Oh, and to actually make `proclaunch` kill everything before dying, kill it with -HUP:

    $ sudo kill -HUP `cat /path/to/some/state/directory/proclaunch.pid`

Now for the automatic restart. Change something about the profiles directory:

    $ touch example_profiles/

In the log you should see that `proclaunch` saw something changed and rescanned immediately. Now change something about `sleeper`:

    $ touch example_profiles/sleeper
    
Within a few seconds, `proclaunch` will notice that something happened and restart `sleeper`. Specifically, it will send `sleeper`'s pid a `SIGTERM`, wait up to 7 seconds for it to actually die, and then send it a `SIGKILL`. Now something a little more drastic:

    $ sudo mv example_profiles/sleeper example_profiles/sleeper2
    
`proclaunch` will notice that `sleeper` is gone, tell it to stop, then start `sleeper2` since it obviously isn't running. You can use this to setup really simple deploys, especially if you're deploying with [Capistrano][]. Just commit your profiles directory to version control and point `proclaunch` at that directory in the `current` symlink, making sure that the pid_file is within the deploy directory somewhere. Within 5 seconds of your deploy, `proclaunch` will see that the inode on the profiles directory changed.

### What is a profile, anyway?

If you look in the `sleeper` directory, you'll see this set of files:

    run
    pid_file
    user
    
`run` is a small script that `proclaunch` expects to execute and have it return in short order, having backgrounded itself and written it's pid to the path contained in `pid_file`. This forms the core of both `proclaunch` and `procer`. Really simple to setup and automate, since there isn't any complicated config file to manage. The `user` file is special to `proclaunch`, and tells it what user to start `run` as. By default, `proclaunch` will start `run` as `root`, which is generally not what you want. `procer` can do some fun things that `proclaunch` can't do yet, like manage dependencies between profiles. If there's any demand I'll work on adding that but I don't currently need it.

### A small digression into Mac OS X

Initially I wanted to use [Privilege::Drop][] from CPAN to drop privileges when spawning profiles. It's a really clean pure perl module that has no dependencies other than perl itself. It even does a bunch of sanity checking to ensure that the privileges you dropped to are specifically what you wanted to drop to. However, on OS X with perl 5.10, it seems that you can't drop a large number of auxiliary groups that Privilege::Drop doesn't know about, at least not in the way that it's currently written. That's why the code for dropping privileges is inlined in `App::ProcLaunch::Profile`. It still checks to make sure that the group you tried to drop to is in the list, but it doesn't assert the list matches exactly what you wanted to do.

*Is this something you'd use if it were packaged up nicely on CPAN? Want to use it even before that? Let me know in the comments.*
