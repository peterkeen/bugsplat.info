Title: Using the Transmission RPC Interface to Organize Torrents

I've been using my Mac mini as a torrent downloader and media server for a few years now using [Transmission][]. Tonight I got fed up with my torrents being in one unsorted mass so I learned the [HTTP RPC api][tr-api] and wrote a simple blocking client that organizes them.

I tried out an [existing client][transmission-client] that I found on GitHub, but it was sort of difficult to use, involving EventMachine and evented techniques. If this was part of a long-running processes I would spend the time to learn how to do this stuff, but this is just a simple script so a blocking technique is just fine.

Here's the client class:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'mechanize'
    require 'json'

    class TransmissionClient
      attr_reader :agent,
                  :header_name,
                  :header_val,
                  :password,
                  :port,
                  :server,
                  :username
    
      def initialize(params)
        @username = params['username']
        @password = params['password']
        @server   = params['server']
        @port     = params['port'] || "9091"
    
        @agent = Mechanize.new
    
        @agent.auth(username, password)
    
        @header_name = ""
        @header_val = ""
      end
    
      def server_uri
        return "http://#{server}:#{port}/transmission/rpc"
      end
    
      def send(method, params)
        resp = ""

        begin 
          resp = agent.post(
            server_uri,
            JSON.generate({
              "method" => method,
              "arguments" => params
            }),
            header_name => header_val
          )

          resp_obj = JSON.parse(resp.body)

          if resp_obj["result"] == "success" then
            return resp_obj["arguments"]
          else
            raise RuntimeError resp.body
          end

        rescue Mechanize::ResponseCodeError => e
          @header_name, @header_val =
              e.page.search("code").first.content.split(/: /)
          retry
        end
      end
    end
    
The only real surprise here is that Transmission sends a session ID  in an error response (http code 409) and expects that session ID to be sent as a header in every request thereafter. Because of how the ruby version of Mechanize works, it's hard to get the headers from the exception that gets thrown on errors, so instead I extract it directly from the response page. Conveniently the `page` property on the exception acts like a [nokogiri][] object so I can just search for the single `code` block on the page and grab the conveniently formatted header.

Here's some code that uses the above class to relocate torrents into folders:

    def get_folder_from_name(name)
      name_parts = name.split(/\./)
      series_parts = []
    
      if name_parts[0].match(/^[0-9]+/) then
        series_parts.push name_parts.shift
      end
    
      name_parts.each do |p|
        break if p.match(/(s?)\d/i)
        series_parts.push p
      end
    
      if series_parts.length > 0 then
        return series_parts.map{|s| s.downcase}.join("_").gsub("aaf-", "")
      else
        return nil
      end
    end

    server_info_str = IO.read("/Users/Peter/.transmission_server");
    server_info = JSON.parse(server_info_str)
    
    client = TransmissionClient.new(server_info)
    
    torrents = client.send("torrent-get", "fields" => %w{id name downloadDir});
    
    torrents["torrents"].each do |t|
      series_name = get_folder_from_name(t["name"])
      next unless series_name
    
      puts "Moving #{t['name']} (#{t['id']}) from #{t['downloadDir']} to #{series_name}";
    
      client.send(
        "torrent-set-location", 
        "ids"      => t["id"], 
        "location" => "/Users/Peter/Movies/#{series_name}",
        "move"     => true
      )
    end

This instanciates a new client and grabs the `id`, `name`, and `downloadDir` fields for each currently active torrent. Then, it extracts a folder name from torrent's name and tells the client to move the torrent into the proper location. The paths are hardcoded because as I said before, this is a pretty stupid simple script. There's no reason they couldn't be in the config file that holds the server info. Also, the function that extracts a folder name is very specific to the torrents I'm working with.
