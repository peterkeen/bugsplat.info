### Experience ##

#### Software Developer, January 2007 - Current ###

[Rentrak Corporation](http://www.rentrak.com), Portland, OR

* Work with a team of seven other developers to maintain and enhance
  a custom data repository that stores billions of television views.
  The repository is a blend of C++, Perl, and PostgreSQL.

* Design, develop, and maintain two different demographics systems
  that overlay demographic and psychographic segments on top of Rentrak's
  television viewing database. The first overlays zip-code level segments
  from the US census and other third-party sources. The other overlays
  household-level demographics from credit reporting agencies as well as
  internally developed behavioral demographics using a custom module
  within the view repository.
  
* Help develop a SQL-like language that compiles to C++ using Perl and
  [Parse::RecDescent](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-RecDescent) to
  enable internal users to query the view repository.

* Designed and deployed a system for distributed job processing using
  [Gearman](http://gearman.org) which will form the core for all new
  distributed or delayed job processing company-wide.

* Designed a new product from scratch with another developer on a three
  month contract, focusing on the backend data processing. Built a simple
  pattern for specifiying summary tables that generates all needed code
  from a DSL-like specification.

* Write one-time and repeatable data extraction and analysis programs
  to support statistical analysis of televsion viewing behavior.

* Implemented an experimental perl-based framework on top of
  [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) and HDFS that was used to test some
  performance hypotheses.

* Worked with another developer and the system administration team to
  convert the entire company from subversion to git. Internal repos are
  hosted using [gitolite](http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite).
  
* Built a video player using Flex that shows DVR-style recordings with
  viewership data overlays.

#### Software Development Intern, Sept 2006 - Dec 2006

Quad Graphics and University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Management and Computer Systems

* Enhanced Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord support for Sybase
* Extended ActiveRecord's ability to generate model objects from
  arbitrary database tables.
* Used these new capabilities to enable repeatable unit testing
  of database-driven .Net applications on developers' desktops by
  pulling only the needed sets of test data from a central database.
  
#### Research Assistant, Fall 2005 - Spring 2006

Aurora Health Care and University of Wisconsin - Whitewater Management Computer Systems

* Implemented a data aggregation system among several dissimilar data silos
  using JSP, servlets, Lucene, jUnit, ant, and MS SQL Server. Silos did not share 
  primary keys and contained similar but not identical profile information, so the 
  system guided a user through a three step selection and matching process.
  
#### Helpdesk Intern, Summer 2006

HouseValues.Com, Kirkland, Washington

* Replaced an existing computer imaging system based on usb harddrives with a network-based
  system using BartPE and Ghost.

  Windows Scripting Host
