Title: Static HTML Blog
Id: static-html-blog
Order: 2

This blog uses a custom [static html blog](http://bugsplat.info/2010-03-28-yet-another-static-html-generator) engine that I wrote for a few different reasons:

 * No external dependencies
 * Maximum flexibility in hosting locations
 * Fast and easy to modify
 * Ability to keep my blog in [version control](https://github.com/peterkeen/bugsplat.info) using [git](http://git-scm.com/)

If you want to use my engine, be warned that it's rather specific to my needs on [bugsplat](http://bugsplat.info). However, there are a few more general, more flexible options out there now:

 * [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
 * [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
 * [Stasis](http://stasis.me/)

I would suggest looking at Jekyll first. It's incredibly simple to get going and has great documentation.
